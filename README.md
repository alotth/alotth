## About Me

I am passionate about the transformative power of technology and excited about a future that is more decentralized, transparent, and efficient. With a background in Mechanical and Software Engineering, I now focus on developing innovative applications. My experience spans both Web2 and Web3: in Web2, I’ve worked on complex ATM networks and developed an OTC trading platform at Noxpay; in Web3, I contributed to the NoxFi project by integrating Next.js with smart contracts and utilizing The Graph for Uniswap V3 data, and built an NFT platform on Polygon using LazyMinting before industry standards emerged.

My journey took me to Thailand, where I served as a Fellow at Invisible Garden in Chiang Mai—coordinating social events, participating in hackathons and workshops—and engaged with the Ethereum ecosystem at Devcon and ETH Global in Bangkok.

Recently, I have also ventured into automation and AI, experimenting with agent frameworks like elizaOS and workflow automation with n8n. Beyond technical work, I have significant entrepreneurial experience managing over 70 clients simultaneously, and my background in event management and Yoga has honed both my interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. Recent readings, such as The Infinite Machine and Vitalik Buterin’s article on Soulbound Tokens, have deepened my understanding of social tokens and their revolutionary potential.
